# TmpoTween

WIP


A module that provides a simple service for creating 
reactive tweens for angular2.

You mostly will not need it and can work with animation framework on Angular based on style/css animations. But sure, one day, you've got on a corner case where
you need to manually do a tween of something.

My use case is working with pixi.js

1. Inject TmpoTweenService
2. TmpoTweenService.to(element, duration, properties)


Example:

```
